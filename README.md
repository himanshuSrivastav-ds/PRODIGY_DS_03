# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Project Overview
This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The analysis uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Objectives
Develop a decision tree model to predict customer purchase behavior.
Analyze the impact of demographic and behavioral factors on purchase decisions.
# Dataset
The Bank Marketing dataset includes features such as:

Demographics: Age, job, marital status, education.
Behavioral Data: Contact type, campaign data, previous marketing outcomes.
Target Variable: Whether the customer subscribed to the product (yes/no).
# Key Steps
Data Preparation:

Load and preprocess data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions and correlations between features.
# Model Building:

Construct a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization:

Plot the decision tree to understand decision-making paths and feature importance.
# Tools & Libraries
Python: For data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: Model building and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
# Key Insights
Feature Importance: Identified key factors influencing purchase decisions.
Model Performance: Evaluated the accuracy and effectiveness of the decision tree classifier.
